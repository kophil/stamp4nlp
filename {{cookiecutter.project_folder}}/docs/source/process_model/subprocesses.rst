Subprocesses
============

Subprocesses are collections of tasks to reach a specific goal. Accomplishing one subprocess is equivalent to a milestone.
The subprocees are not limited to a sequential flow, futhermore several loops and returns facilitate an agile process to fit the requirements on the application:
Five subprocesses are arraned in two nested loops: Development Loop (green + solid) for developing the NLP application and model.
Evolution Loop (blue + dashed) surrounds the Development Loop and covers mainly the interaction with the customer:
creation and refinement of the project goals with associated requirements and integration and monitoring of the application.

The following subprocesses are part of STAMP 4 NLP.
