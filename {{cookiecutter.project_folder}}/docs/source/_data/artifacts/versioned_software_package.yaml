description:
  The runnable software that contains all required dependencies and models (see Software Package).
  Also contains information about its machine learning configuration and quality metrics.
  The versioning of the packaged software together with the configuration and quality metrics serves the purpose of transparency and reproducibility.
  If in practice a newer version of the software and model perform worse than an older version, an earlier version can easily be restored.
